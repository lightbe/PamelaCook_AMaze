# A Maze - Unity VR Project

"A Maze" is a fun virtual reality game created by Pamela Cook of [LightBe Corp](https://www.lightbe.com/). You will navigate through a medieval scene using waypoints with the goal of opening the temple door at the opposite end of the scene. However there are tasks you must complete before opening the door.

To play: Read the instruction text box. Click the instruction text box to begin. Navigate the maze by clicking the green waypoints along the way. There are seven coins and one key that can be collected. The key and all the coins must be collected before you will be able to "unlock" and open the door. Click the door to open it. If you click the door before collecting the key and all the coins a message displays with what needs to be done with the door remaining closed. To start over after succcessfully opening the door click the green text above the treasure chest.

This game was created using Unity 2017.2.0f3 and GoogleVR SDK 1.70.0 for iOS with the minimum version of 10.0. This project has been executed on an iPhone 6 Plus running the latest stable version of both iOS 11 and iOS 12.
